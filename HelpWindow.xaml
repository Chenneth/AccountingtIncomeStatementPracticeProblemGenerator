            <LineBreak/>This program was made to help practice knowledge on some formulas for the income statement.
            The focus is mainly the portions of the income statement that come above Gross Profit.
            <LineBreak/><LineBreak/>In particular, this is based on a&#160;<Italic>merchandising business'</Italic>&#160;income statement.
            This means that there will be a Cost of Goods Sold calculation rather than what is seen in manufacturing and service businesses' 
            income statements.
